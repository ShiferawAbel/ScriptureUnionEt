                  The Scripture Union, whose lives have been changed by the word of God; It is a community of 
                  saints who gave their lives to walk in the will of God as revealed in the Holy Word. The identity of 
                  the Union originates from the Holy Word. What God intended to do from creation to new creation 
                  in his son Jesus Christ does revealed by the Holy Word. Scripture Union firmly believes that the 
                  word of God, which gives life; is the manifestation of His will (Hebrews 4:12). Since the way of the 
                  word is the way of God, SU takes the truth that "Your law is a lamp to my feet and a light to my 
                  path" (Ps. 119:105) as a leading quotation of the Union. The Scripture Union , as a community of 
                  believers, is dedicated to living and even serving by reading and obeying the word, realizing its 
                  importance in the daily lives of believers (2 Tim. 3:16-17).
