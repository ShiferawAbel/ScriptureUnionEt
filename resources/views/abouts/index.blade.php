                        The Scripture Union, whose lives have been changed by the word of God; It is a community of
                        saints who gave their lives to walk in the will of God as revealed in the Holy Word. The
                        identity of
                        the Union originates from the Holy Word. What God intended to do from creation to new creation
                        in his son Jesus Christ does revealed by the Holy Word. Scripture Union firmly believes that the
                        word of God, which gives life; is the manifestation of His will (Hebrews 4:12). Since the way of
                        the
                        word is the way of God, SU takes the truth that "Your law is a lamp to my feet and a light to my
                        path" (Ps. 119:105) as a leading quotation of the Union. The Scripture Union , as a community of
                        believers, is dedicated to living and even serving by reading and obeying the word, realizing
                        its
                        importance in the daily lives of believers (2 Tim. 3:16-17).

                The Scripture Union of Ethiopia (SU) is a ministry that is closely related to the Word of God,
                children and young adults. The ministry was established in London in 1867, and its beginning was
                when 15 children gathered in an art school to hear the word of God. The service gained acceptance
                in a short period of time and expanded its reach and continued serving 55 children in a school. The
                Scripture Union gathers children and young adults in school and outside of school in various ways
                and serve them to read the Bible and accept the Lord Jesus as their personal savior. It prepares and
                distributes daily bible reading cards in different languages so that children, teenagers and adults can
                read the life-changing word of God. Scripture Union is giving service in more than one hundred
                and thirty (130) countries around the world.

            <p class="p-styled wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5">
                Nowadays, we hear a lot of shocking and sad news about students every day. The Bible tells us that
                the times are stressful and full of evil (2 Tim. 3:1-5). If we list the manifestations of evil, where
                the
                fear of God is lost, where despair reigns, where love of money is prevalent, where avarice is
                widespread, where aimless life is spread, where sexual purity is lost, where students are subject to
                various addictions, we will not be able to count them. Students are vulnerable to identity crisis,
                negative peer pressure, social media influence, and other problems
            </p>
            <p class="p-styled wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5">
                On the other hand, another aspect of the times is the deep desire among students to follow and
                serve the Lord Jesus. We are seeing that students are paying great attention to fellowship, the study
                of God's Word, prayer and witnessing the gospel. Providing this outstanding demand , serving
                students should be the primary focus of stakeholders. Failure to address healthy needs in an
                appropriate manner creates an opportunity for a generation to be shaped in the wrong way.

                In an age full of opportunities and threats, what is God's purpose for high school students? What
                do you think he wants to see in high school? What could be the enthusiasm of the parents, the
                church and the community?
            </p>
            <p class="p-styled wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5">
                God wants middle and high school students to be partakers of His zeal. He called them to share
                the hope of life with those who have lost the purpose of life, those who are prisoners of various
                addictions, and those who are in various sin circles.

            <p class="p-styled wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5">
                He wants Christian students to be evangelists of the good news of the gospel, which is spoken
                through life and through words. He equips them in various ways to be worthy of the call.

            <p class="p-styled wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5">
                Parents want their children to demonstrate Life Excellence, Academic Excellence and Ministry
                Excellence. Those who love and fear the Lord, excel in their studies, and want to serve God's
                kingdom with the gifts and skills they have been given. The enthusiasm and interest of the local
                church and the community will not be different from the parentsâ€™. They want their children to live
                for the glory of God. We call this kind of life Coram-Deo high school Life. Daniel and his friends
                who were students in the country of Babylon (Daniel Chapter. 1-6) are an example of this life as a
                student. They were students who showed excellence in their studies, their lives were not polluted by
                the evil of the time, they had a close intimacy with their God, and they introduced their God to
                nonbelievers and nations.

                                        Serving students is our calling. It is also a steward we received from God. We

                                        by paying all the costs required to serve them (Mark 10:45). Jesus showed us the
                                        value of service by
                                        being human, being among people, and paying the price on the cross to serve
                                        people (Philippians
                                        2:5-7). Servant hood comes from loving God, from a heart willing to do His will
                                        (2 Cor. 5:14, John
                                        21:15-17). We use all the grace, knowledge and skills, life experiences, time
