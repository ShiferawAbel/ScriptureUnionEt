                                        being human, being among people, and paying the price on the cross to serve
                                        people (Philippians
                                        2:5-7). Servant hood comes from loving God, from a heart willing to do His will
                                        (2 Cor. 5:14, John
                                        21:15-17). We use all the grace, knowledge and skills, life experiences, time

                                  <p class="m-0 w-75 m-auto text-center">Serving students is our calling. It is also a steward we received from God. We serve them faithfully 
                                      by paying all the costs required to serve them (Mark 10:45). Jesus showed us the value of service by 
                                      being human, being among people, and paying the price on the cross to serve people (Philippians 
                                      2:5-7). Servant hood comes from loving God, from a heart willing to do His will (2 Cor. 5:14, John 
                                      21:15-17). We use all the grace, knowledge and skills, life experiences, time and money we have 
                                      received from God to serve students.

                                  <p class="m-0 w-75 m-auto text-center">SU is a praying ministry. We believe that student ministry cannot be accomplished without fervent 
                                      prayer. Therefore, in any situation, we put prayer first (Philippians 4:6). We strive to know God's 
                                      will through prayer. In prayer we come before God for thanksgiving. In prayer, we show that we
                                      love our God. We firmly believe in the advice of the Holy Word to pray without ceasing (1 
                                      Thessalonians 5:17-18).
